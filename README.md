# Machine-Learning

 ## Project Description
The mobile operator “Megaline” figured out that many customers use archive tariffs. They want to build a system capable of analyzing customer behavior and offering users a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra". 
We have a data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to these tariffs. We need to build a model for the classification problem that will choose the appropriate tariff. The dataset is already prepared for the analyzing.
We must build the model with the maximum accuracy value. Also, we will check the accuracy on the test sample. 
Accuracy is a metric in machine learning for analyzing the quality of built model
